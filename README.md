- Group 7 (Anette, Blessing, Jay & Lindo)
- ðŸ”­ We are currently working on [The Effect of Delaying Intervention on the Number of cases of Ebola Outbreak in Congo.](https://github.com/djayeprokash/Week1_MMED_Ebola.git)
- The work is about building an SEIR Model to get a deterministic disease dynamics. To account for the the stochasticity of the outbreak, we used a Markov chain model.
- A graph of the final epidemic size versus the delay in time intervention was plotted.
- The Program was written in R.
- Jupyter notebook was used for this project. The program has 2 extensions: .ipynb and .r
